Sprints
=======

Joining a sprint is fun. Imagine the opportunity to meet and code with people
that also love Python. Sprints are productive, a time to build skills, and
share knowledge.

Consider joining the annual PyCon sprints or sprints at other conferences or
user groups. Don't worry if you are new to CPython -- everybody is a beginner
at something.
