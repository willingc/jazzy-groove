The Jazzy Groove Guide to CPython Contribution
==============================================

Welcome to the The Jazzy Groove Guide to CPython Contribution.

This unofficial, concise, *inspirational* guide exists to provide contributors
warm and welcoming encouragement to jump into CPython (core Python).

**This guide is under development.**

The `official documentation of CPython <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_ is very
detailed, helpful, and highly recommended reading. A nod of appreciation to
documentation contributors, past and present. A good "first stop" doc is the
`Python Developer's Guide <https://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html>`_.

One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. You have rhythm. You have
interest. Next step? Start finding your CPython contribution groove.
